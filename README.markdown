  BACULA
 ========

 Modified Default Bacula Files for Bacula 5.2.13. These files have been tested on:
 
    Debian 7.2

 INSTRUCTIONS
 ------------
 
 Copy these files to your Bacula server. I would recommend copying these files to a temportary directory first.
 Then change all the example server, client and email addresses to match your installation, as well as changing
 all of the passwords to the passwords your Bacula installation is using.
